# MATLAB 圆柱体()

> 原文:[https://www.javatpoint.com/matlab-3d-cylinder](https://www.javatpoint.com/matlab-3d-cylinder)

圆柱体创建单位圆柱体的 x、y 和 z 坐标。我们可以使用 surf 或 mesh 绘制圆柱形对象，或者通过不提供输出参数来立即绘制它。

### 句法

```

[X, Y, Z] = cylinder // It returns the x, y, and z coordinates of a cylinder with a radius similar to 1\. The cylinder has 20 similar spaced points around its circumference.
[X, Y, Z] = cylinder(r) // It returns the x, y, and z coordinates of a cylinder using r to describe a profile curve. cylinder treats each component in r as a radius at equally spaced heights along with the unit height of the cylinder. 
[X,Y,Z] = cylinder(r,n) // It returns the x, y, and z coordinates of a cylinder based on the profile curve described by vector r. The cylinder has n similar spaced points around its circumference.
cylinder(...) // with no output arguments, plot the cylinder using MATLAB surf.

```

### 例子

```

r=sin?(3π z)+2
0≤z≤1,0≤θ≤2θ
z=[0: .02:1]';
r=sin(3*pi*z)+2;
cyclinder(r), axis square

```

**输出:**
