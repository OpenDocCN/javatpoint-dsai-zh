# MATLAB 嵌套循环

> 原文:[https://www.javatpoint.com/matlab-nested-loop](https://www.javatpoint.com/matlab-nested-loop)

MATLAB 还允许在另一个循环中使用一个循环。

**MATLAB 中嵌套 for 循环语句的语法如下:**

```

for m = 1:j 
for n = 1:k 
 <statements>;

       end 
end

```

**MATLAB 中嵌套 while 循环语句的语法如下:**

```

while <expression1>
 while <expression2>
      <statements>
      end
end

```

## 示例:

我们可以使用嵌套的 for 循环来显示从 1 到 100 的所有素数。

```

for i=2:100
         for j=2:100
               if(~mod(i, j))
                    break; % if factor found, not prime
              end
        end
        if(j > (i/j))
                  fprintf('%d is prime\n', i);
        end
end 

```

**输出:**

```
2 is prime
3 is prime
5 is prime
7 is prime
11 is prime
13 is prime
17 is prime
19 is prime
23 is prime
29 is prime
31 is prime
37 is prime
41 is prime
43 is prime
47 is prime
53 is prime
59 is prime
61 is prime
67 is prime
71 is prime
73 is prime
79 is prime
83 is prime
89 is prime
97 is prime

```
